/**
 * <p>
 * JSONSerializer is the main class for performing serialization of Java objects
 * to JSON.  JSONSerializer by default performs a shallow serialization.  While
 * this might seem strange there is a method to this madness.  Shallow serialization
 * allows the developer to control what is serialized out of the object graph.
 * This helps with performance, but more importantly makes good OO possible, fixes
 * the circular reference problem, and doesn't require boiler plate translation code.
 * You don't have to change your object model to make JSON work so it reduces your
 * work load, and keeps you
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Let's go through a simple example:
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *    JSONSerializer serializer = new JSONSerializer();
 *    return serializer.serialize( person );
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * What this statement does is output the json from the instance of person.  So
 * the JSON we might see for this could look like:
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *    { "class": "com.mysite.Person",
 *      "firstname": "Charlie",
 *      "lastname": "Rose",
 *      "age", 23
 *      "birthplace": "Big Sky, Montanna"
 *    }
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In this case it's look like it's pretty standard stuff.  But, let's say
 * Person had many hobbies (i.e. Person.hobbies is a java.util.List).  In
 * this case if we executed the code above we'd still getTransformer the same output.
 * This is a very important feature of flexjson, and that is any instance
 * variable that is a Collection, Map, or Object reference won't be serialized
 * by default.  This is what gives flexjson the shallow serialization.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * How would we include the <em>hobbies</em> field?  Using the {@link JSONSerializer#include}
 * method allows us to include these fields in the serialization process.  Here is
 * how we'd do that:
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *    return new JSONSerializer().include("hobbies").serialize( person );
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * That would produce output like:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *    { "class": "com.mysite.Person",
 *      "firstname": "Charlie",
 *      "lastname": "Rose",
 *      "age", 23
 *      "birthplace": "Big Sky, Montanna",
 *      "hobbies", [
 *          "poker",
 *          "snowboarding",
 *          "kite surfing",
 *          "bull riding"
 *      ]
 *    }
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * If the <em>hobbies</em> field contained objects, say Hobby instances, then a
 * shallow copy of those objects would be performed.  Let's go further and say
 * <em>hobbies</em> had a List of all the people who enjoyed this hobby.
 * This would create a circular reference between Person and Hobby.  Since the
 * shallow copy is being performed on Hobby JSONSerialize won't serialize the people
 * field when serializing Hobby instances thus breaking the chain of circular references.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * But, for the sake of argument and illustration let's say we wanted to send the
 * <em>people</em> field in Hobby.  We can do the following:
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *    return new JSONSerializer().include("hobbies.people").serialize( person );
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * JSONSerializer is smart enough to know that you want <em>hobbies</em> field included and
 * the <em>people</em> field inside hobbies' instances too.  The dot notation allows you
 * do traverse the object graph specifying instance fields.  But, remember a shallow copy
 * will stop the code from getting into an infinte loop.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * You can also use the exclude method to exclude fields that would be included.  Say
 * we have a User object.  It would be a serious security risk if we sent the password
 * over the network.  We can use the exclude method to prevent the password field from
 * being sent.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *   return new JSONSerialize().exclude("password").serialize(user);
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * JSONSerializer will also pay attention to any method or field annotated by
 * {@link com.springapp.flexjson.JSON}.  You can include and exclude fields permenantly using the
 * annotation.  This is good like in the case of User.password which should never
 * ever be sent through JSON.  However, fields like <em>hobbies</em> or
 * <em>favoriteMovies</em> depends on the situation so it's best NOT to annotate
 * those fields, and use the {@link JSONSerializer#include} method.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * In a shallow copy only these types of instance fields will be sent:
 * <strong>String</strong>, <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Number</strong>,
 * <strong>Boolean</strong>, <strong>Character</strong>, <strong>Enum</strong>,
 * <strong>Object</strong> and <strong>null</strong>.  Subclasses of Object will be serialized
 * except for Collection or Arrays.  Anything that would cause a N objects would not be sent.
 * All types will be excluded by default.  Fields marked static or transient are not serialized.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Includes and excludes can include wildcards.  Wildcards allow you to do things like exclude
 * all class attributes.  For example *.class would remove the class attribute that all objects
 * have when serializing.  A open ended wildcard like * would cause deep serialization to take
 * place.  Be careful with that one.  Although you can limit it's depth with an exclude like
 * *.foo.  The order of evaluation of includes and excludes is the order in which you called their
 * functions.  First call to those functions will cause those expressions to be evaluated first.
 * The first expression to match a path that action will be taken thus short circuiting all other
 * expressions defined later.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Transforers are a new addition that allow you to modify the values that are being serialized.
 * This allows you to create different output for certain conditions.  This is very important in
 * web applications.  Say you are saving your text to the DB that could contain &lt; and &gt;.  If
 * you plan to add that content to your HTML page you'll need to escape those characters.  Transformers
 * allow you to do this.  Flexjson ships with a simple HTML encoder {@link com.springapp.flexjson.transformer.HtmlEncoderTransformer}.
 * Transformers are specified in dot notation just like include and exclude methods, but it doesn't
 * support wildcards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * JSONSerializer is safe to use the serialize() methods from two seperate
 * threads.  It is NOT safe to use combination of {@link JSONSerializer#include(String...)}
 * {@link JSONSerializer#transform(com.springapp.flexjson.transformer.Transformer, String...)}, or {@link JSONSerializer#exclude(String...)}
 * from multiple threads at the same time.  It is also NOT safe to use
 * {@link JSONSerializer#serialize(Object)} and include/exclude/transform from
 * multiple threads.  The reason for not making them more thread safe is to boost performance.
 * Typical use case won't call for two threads to modify the JsonSerializer at the same type it's
 * trying to serialize.
 * </p>
